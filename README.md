Are you ready to embark on a journey of relaxation and rejuvenation like never before? Try Spring Search, a Java search engine that optimize the way you explore the world of hot springs.

Spring Search takes your hot spring search to the next level. It begins by gathering the top 20 search results from Google in response to your query. Next, it crawls through each of those webpages and their subpages, evaluating their content, assigning a relevance score based on their connection to hot springs, and stored the scores in tree nodes. Finally, the application sums up the scores for each webpage (tree) and re-ranks the webpages to ensure that the results you receive are precisely tailored to satisfy your hot spring cravings.

#### | 🌟 Key Features
- Precision Search: Evaluate web contents specifically for hot spring search.
